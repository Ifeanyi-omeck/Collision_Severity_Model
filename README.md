# Collision_Severity_Model

"I constructed a Zero-Inflated Ordered Probit Model to analyze the influence of different lighting conditions on collision severity. I specifically explored how accident severity varied between daytime and nighttime, considering various factors such as vehicle age, weight, and class.

Within this project:
- I authored code for conducting Vuong tests, calculating marginal effects, and evaluating AIC and BIC metrics.
- I incorporated unobserved heterogeneity in the dataset to uncover underlying patterns.
- I performed statistical estimation of both true and conditional states within the model's framework.
- I designed custom code for assessing the model's performance, including Vuong tests, marginal effects, Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
- Lastly, I derived actionable recommendations based on the model's insights to drive potential road safety improvements.

Explore the details of this model to gain valuable insights into how lighting conditions and vehicle attributes influence collision severity."
